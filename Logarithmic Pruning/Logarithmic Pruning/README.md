This repo holds the codes for [Logarithmic Regularizer for DNN Pruning]


The codes for MNIST is within `mnist/` folder. Please follow the README file in each folder to run the experiments. Codes are tested with Pytorch 1.2.0 and Python 3.6.8, tqdm package is preferred for better visualization of the training process.
